# OPL (Other People's Lines)

In the autumn of 2019, I set out to construct a broader understanding of the basic affordances that Ruby on Rails provides. 

Wary of building [inert knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_knowledge) and all-too-familiar with the thorniness of [transfer of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_learning), I decided to build a slightly-more-complex-than-CRUD app in parallel to reading through the (_excellent!_) [RailsGuides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/). In particular, I settled on an app to email me daily quotes from a (_~980-record_) plaintext file I'd been lackadaisically populating since my late teens.

Shortly into the project, I realized two things: [1] auth, full-text search, and frontend asset-management would never come easy w/o deliberate engagement; and [2] those RailsGuides are _hefty:_ lots of content there. As such, I expanded my initial "MVC and a bit more" app-blueprint to include each of those fields, too (_and, I'd hoped, better balance the coding-to-notetaking activity ratio._)

I'm writing this in January 2020, and by my private roadmap I'm - maybe - 2/3 of the way done. ðŸ˜…

A couple more-detailed posts on the project will be trickling out at [ye olde miniblog](https://www.suss.world/) over the coming spring; in the interim, should you want to spin up a copy of your own, read on...
